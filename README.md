## The Kuramoto Model
The above code simulates the Kuramoto model, with oscillators being the dots moving around the circle. 
With a certain coupling strength (K), the oscillators tend towards moving in phase.

#### Running the Simulation
1. Download the files "kuramoto.py", "plot.py", and "run.py"
2. Adjust the parameters as you wish in run.py's driver function.
```
python3 run.py
```
